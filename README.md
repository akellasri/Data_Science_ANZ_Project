# Data_Science_ANZ_Project

## Project Description: ##

1. Worked on banking transactions of 3 months data set for more number of customers that has purchases, recurring transactions and salary transactions.
2. Gathered insights by finding data issues, cleaning the data, grouping the similar data by transactions date and time and visualising the transactions volume.
3. Created a simple regression and decision tree model to predict the annual salary of the individual customer and tested the performance of these 2 models accurately.
4. Results showed that these two models are high bias and high variance and thus not good models for this predictive analysis.
